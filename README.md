This is a simple hotel management system. It's programmed in Python 3.

Dependencies:
<br>
- sqlite3 (comes with Python 3)
<br>
<br>
Setup:
Create a sqlite3 file called reservations.db in the MP3 directory.
<br>
<br>
I may add more complex functionality later. I don't know. It's for a school project. That's due tomorrow.
